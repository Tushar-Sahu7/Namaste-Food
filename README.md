## 🌐 Handling CORS (Cross-Origin Requests)

Since the project fetches data from the **Swiggy API**, you may face **CORS issues** while running locally.
👉 To fix this during development, install the Chrome extension:
[Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/hnlimanpjeeomjnpdglldcnpkppmndbp)

* After installation, **enable the extension** while running the app locally.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

Code coverage reports are generated using **Istanbul**.
